- Use dynamic imports with `next/dynamic` for code splitting and lazy loading.
- Implement proper error boundaries using `error.js` in the App Router.
- Utilize `next/image` for optimized image loading and lazy loading.
- Use `next/font` for font optimization and better performance.
- Implement internationalization with `next-intl` for seamless multi-language support.
