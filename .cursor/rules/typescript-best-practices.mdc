- Use strict null checks to prevent null and undefined errors.
- Prefer interfaces over types for object shapes to improve readability.
- Utilize type guards and assertions for runtime type checking.
- Implement proper type inference to reduce unnecessary type annotations.
- Use Zod for schema validation and type inference in forms and data models.
